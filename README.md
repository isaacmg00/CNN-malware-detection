## Binary classification with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

A dataset containing 15036 samples with 215 features and 2 classes (malign or benign) was used to train a CNN. As android malware attacks become increasingly popular, it is important to be able to classify whether a certain set of features containing kernel settings, app permissions, etc., correspond to an infected system (malign) or not (benign).

The CNN was implemented using tensorflow (see notebook) and achieved a classification accuracy of 99.68% after splitting the dataset 70/30 for training/testing.
